## PHANTOM BOOKMARKS

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MayaWright20/phantom-bookmarks.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Vercel 
A link to the hosted website can be found here [Vercel](https://phantom-bookmarks-three.vercel.app/)

Full documentation can be found at [Bookmarks Documentation](https://watery-turquoise-b47.notion.site/Phantom-Frontend-Developer-Test-f01307b9e59b4380b1f26ac3318996c3?pvs=4)

## Design Choices 
 - simple design inspired by photos in the 'Design Inspo' section of [Bookmarks Documentation](https://watery-turquoise-b47.notion.site/Phantom-Frontend-Developer-Test-f01307b9e59b4380b1f26ac3318996c3?pvs=4)
 - confetti shown when user enters a URL for the first time 

## Areas to improve on given more time
- Add more css hover effects for icons 
- I would make the alerts / warning look better 
- Thank you message and 'Bookmarks' title would be an svg that morphs the text from 'Bookmarks' to 'Thank you'. 
- Add catagories that can be filtered 
- Prevent user from adding the same url twice

## Time Spent
I ended up spending more than four hours on the task. If I was to start again I would not have used the Tailwind template as it gave me upexpected errors in my css
